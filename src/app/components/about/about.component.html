        The Quran is the holy book of Islam and is regarded by Muslims as the
        unaltered word of God (Allah), revealed through the Prophet Muhammad. It
        consists of 114 chapters, known as Surahs, which are further divided
        into verses (Ayat).

      </ul>
      <p>
        The Quran was transmitted orally during Muhammad's lifetime and compiled
        shortly after his death. Muslims view its preservation and authenticity
        as a testament to divine care.
